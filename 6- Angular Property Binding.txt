1- Like string you can bind any property of any tag with a function / method, like if you want to set a time interval of a button for being enabled and disabled.
2- in TS file, in export class, first select the default value you want out side the constructor and then in the constructor the set interval to change the value after some time and 
after that in HTML file 
you can bind a property by covering it in [propertyName]="methodName".
for eg
TS:
currentBtnStatus = false;

    constructor(){
        setTimeout(() => {
        return this.currentBtnStatus = true;
        }, 2000);
    }


Html :
<button class="btn btn-warning" [disabled]="!currentBtnStatus">Click Me</button>
