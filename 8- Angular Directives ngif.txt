1- Directives are instructions in DOM.
2- *ngIf, it changes the structure so it's a structural directive, It needs a boolean to work.
3- it's basically a IF statement and it will show something when it will get a value of true.
4- by default the method after *ngIf will be false, and after a method it will become a true and relevent item will pop up in the DOM.

<p *ngIf="serverCreation">Server was created and server name is {{serverName}}</p>

 serverCreation = false;

    updateServerStatus(){
        this.serverCreation = true;
        return this.serverStatus = "Online"
    }

serverCreation was false by default so after a click on button, it becomes true and the P will popup.


if you want to use else, then you can add another ngif with ! with it.
best way is to add *ngIf="serverCreation"; else elseStatement, you can use any name for this else flag.
then in else you have to make a ng-template tag with #elseStatement, FLAG NAME, and write your code into it.


<p *ngIf="serverCreation; else elseStatement">Server was created and server name is {{serverName}}</p>
<ng-template #elseStatement>
<p>
    No server was created.
</p>
</ng-template>
